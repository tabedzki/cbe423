    "For the molecule lovers in the audience, let's calculate a transition state for the C-H bond dissociation of methane (CH4). For this exercise, we will use a semi-empirical quantum chemistry method called GFN1-xTB as our calculator (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b01176). We will cover such methods later, and it is not the focal point for now.\n",
